RECENT NEWS:
The latest developments regarding the US banning the sharing of deepfake nudes in 2024 involve ongoing efforts to regulate deepfakes and their harmful content, particularly in the context of sexual exploitation and harassment.

- **Legislative Efforts**: There are several bills and acts being considered in the US Congress aimed at regulating deepfakes. For instance, the **DEEPFAKES Accountability Act** (introduced in September 2023) aims to protect national security and provide legal recourse to victims of harmful deepfakes, including those with explicit sexual content[5].
  
- **State Regulations**: Various states have already passed legislation to ban the spread of deepfakes, including those involving minors and explicit content. For example, **Texas** has criminalized images created to portray a minor engaged in sexual conduct, while **Florida** has also criminalized deepfakes involving minors in a similar manner[3].
  
- **Federal Action**: The US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is working on finalizing rules to ban the use of deepfakes that impersonate people, which could extend to protecting against the creation and dissemination of explicit deepfakes[1][2].

These collective efforts indicate a growing concern about the misuse of deepfake technology for sexual exploitation and harassment, with both federal and state actions being taken to address these issues in 2024 and beyond.

RECENT NEWS:
In 2024, Adam Neumann's bid to buy back WeWork was unsuccessful. Here is a brief summary of the latest developments:

- **Rejection of Bid**: A New Jersey bankruptcy judge rejected Neumann's attempt to buy back WeWork, favoring a $450 million bid from SoftBank and Yardi Systems instead[1][3][5].
- **Financial Package**: Neumann had submitted a $500 million financing package to purchase WeWork, but it was not accepted[2][4].
- **Critical Assessment**: Neumann criticized WeWork's emerging bankruptcy plan, calling it "unrealistic and unlikely to succeed"[1][3][5].
- **Flow's Involvement**: Despite the bid failure, Neumann's real estate startup, Flow, which he co-founded after being ousted from WeWork, continues to operate and may compete or partner with WeWork in the future[1].

Thus, Adam Neumann will not regain control of WeWork in 2024.

RECENT NEWS:
As of November 2024, SpaceX has already conducted several Starship test flights, with three successful launches in 2024. While not all these launches have reached outer space, one of the recent flights did include a suborbital trajectory targeting a splashdown in the Indian Ocean, indicating that at least some of the Starship upper stages have reached space.

Here is a brief summary of the latest developments:

- **Recent Launches**: SpaceX launched its 400-foot-tall Starship megarocket for the sixth time on November 19, 2024. The mission included a Super Heavy booster that splashed down in the Gulf of Mexico after not catching the launch tower with its "chopsticks" arms, and the upper stage successfully re-lit one of its engines in space before hitting its targeted splashdown zone in the Indian Ocean[1][3][4].
  
- **Future Plans**: SpaceX aims to increase the number of annual Starship launches from five to 25 in 2025, with the goal of eventually launching multiple Starships per day[1][3].

- **NASA's Perspective**: NASA is closely watching SpaceX's progress and is looking forward to the next Starship test flight, which could happen as early as next week. The agency is awaiting significant milestones in the development of the lunar lander version of the Starship[5].

Thus, while not all five recent Starship launches in 2024 reached outer space, some have successfully demonstrated capabilities in space, and future launches are expected to continue advancing this technology further.
